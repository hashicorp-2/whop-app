## 📊 Vision Comparison: Evolution from Idea Generator to Apex Predator

| Component | Old Vision (Idea Generator) | New Vision (Apex Predator Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ideation** | Generates a single, monolithic product idea. | **Athena Engine:** Generates a `Dominance Dossier` with 3 pre-vetted, distinct concepts based on competitive gap analysis. |
| **Execution** | Compiles a blueprint of text assets (copy). | **Hermes Agent:** Compiles a full blueprint of text assets **AND** triggers the **Hephaestus Forge**. |
| **Asset Creation** | User must manually create images/design. | **Hephaestus Forge:** Automatically generates 3 hyper-optimized, on-brand image prompts (Thumbnail, Hero, Ad Creative) for immediate use. |
| **Optimization** | None. User launches and hopes for the best. | **Ares Engine:** Provides statistically superior A/B test variants based on live performance data, creating a continuous optimization loop. |
| **Core Value** | Time-saving. | **Risk-elimination and guaranteed optimization.** |
